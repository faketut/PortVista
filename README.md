## ðŸš€ How to Use This Simulator

### 1. Create Sample Data  
Generate random price series using **correlated assets** to simulate realistic market behavior.

### 2. Initialize Simulator & Load Data  
Set up the simulation environment and input your asset price data.

### 3. Calculate Returns & Covariance Matrix  
Compute historical **log returns** and the **covariance matrix** for the assets.

### 4. Set Portfolio Weights  
Define asset allocation by assigning weights to each asset in the portfolio.

### 5. Run Monte Carlo Simulation  
Simulate multiple future scenarios using **Geometric Brownian Motion** and **Cholesky decomposition**.

### 6. Calculate Risk Metrics  
Estimate portfolio risk through:
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**
- **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**

### 7. Generate Visual Charts  
Create and save intuitive visualizations such as:
- Simulated price paths
- Distribution of simulated portfolio returns
- VaR and CVaR charts

### 8. Export Risk Reports  
Generate professional PDF or HTML reports summarizing the simulation and risk analysis results.
